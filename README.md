## 🧠 What It Does

GPTree GUI lets you visually select which files from your local project to include in a combined file tree + code output — perfect for pasting into ChatGPT, Claude, or a local LLM. It gives you full control over what the model sees, while respecting your privacy and workflow.

## ⚡ Why Use GPTree?

Other tools (like Cursor or cloud-based repo summarizers) either:

- Automatically include irrelevant files
- Require installing a new IDE or extension
- Send your code to the cloud without control

**GPTree GUI is different**:

- 🧩 Pick only what you want the model to see
- 🧠 Use _your own_ LLM (OpenAI, Claude, LM Studio, etc.)
- 🖥️ Works offline and respects `.gitignore`
- ⚡ Outputs ready-to-paste markdown + source in seconds

> “It’s not an AI copilot — it’s the pre-flight checklist before the prompt.”

## ✅ Features

- **Visual File/Folder Tree** – Easily browse and toggle file selection
- **Output Panel** – Preview the file tree + selected code content in one scrollable blob
- **Clipboard Export** – Copy or save the LLM-ready output in one click
- **Smart Ignoring** – Automatically skips `.gitignore`d files and large binaries
- **Config Manager** – Toggle and edit global/project-specific configs in the UI
- **Dark/Light Mode** – Adapts to system or manual preference
- **Blazing Fast + Lightweight** – Uses ~100MB RAM total
